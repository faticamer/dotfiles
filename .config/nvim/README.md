# Setup

When opening Neovim for the first time, **lazy** plugin manager should handle the installation of necessary Neovim plugins except for the Markdown Preview.

## Markdown Preview

According to the [Official Documentation](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim), to install this plugin, either npm, pnpm, or yarn is required.

## Run install.sh

Give the script necessary permissions for execution:

```bash
sudo chmod +x install.sh
```

Then, simply run the script:
```bash
./install.sh
```

This will install the Node.js, along with the npm package manager that **Markdown Preview** plugin requires.
